</p>

### 🌐 **Privacy-First Software**
Building open-source alternatives that respect autonomy – lightweight by design, transparent by default, and forged through **collective necessity**.  
**Guiding principle:** "Privacy isn't a feature – it's the foundation." 🔒

---

## 🧭 **Core Principles**
- **📜 GPL-3.0 Sovereignty**: Fork, modify, and redistribute without gatekeepers
- **👁️ Anti-Surveillance Engineering**: Zero telemetry, zero hidden pipelines
- **⚡ Lightweight > Bloat**: Optimized for purpose, not corporate checklists
- **🌐 Community-Governed**: Priorities set by real needs, not internal agendas

---

## 🤔 **Why "451.WTF"?**
This collective’s identity merges the [HTTP 451 status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/451) with a domain demanding answers:  
*"Unavailable For Legal Reasons – WTF?!"*  
We create tools that bypass digital constraints through **action**, not petitions.
